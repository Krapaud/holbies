You create an alias using the 'alias' command, for example: alias ll='ls -la'. This creates a shortcut 'll' that executes 'ls -la'.",

LTS versions are typically more stable and are recommended for production environments. Examples include Ubuntu LTS releases (supported for 5 years) and Node.js LTS versions.",

If the original file is deleted, the symbolic link becomes broken. You create symbolic links using 'ln -s target linkname'. Symbolic links can point to files on different filesystems.",

                "answer": "A hard link is a direct reference to the data of a file on the filesystem. Unlike symbolic links, hard links point directly to the inode (the actual data) rather than the filename. Multiple hard links can exist for the same file, and the file only gets deleted when all hard links are removed. Hard links cannot span across different filesystems and cannot link to directories.",

You can specify a different user with 'su username'. It requires the target user's password. 'su -' provides a complete login environment for the target user.",

                "answer": "The command 'chmod ugo+x file_name' adds execute permission (+x) to the file for all users: user/owner (u), group (g), and others (o). This makes the file executable by everyone. The '+' means add permission, 'x' means execute permission, and 'ugo' specifies that it applies to user, group, and others.",

                "question": "What is the value of rw-r--r--?",
                "answer": "The permission string 'rw-r--r--' represents: owner has read and write permissions (rw-), group has read-only permission (r--), and others have read-only permission (r--). In octal notation, this equals 644: owner (6=4+2=read+write), group (4=read), others (4=read).",

                "answer": "chgrp (change group) is a command used to change the group ownership of files and directories. The syntax is 'chgrp groupname filename'. Only the file owner or root can change the group ownership. For example, 'chgrp developers myfile.txt' changes the group ownership of myfile.txt to the 'developers' group.",

                "answer": "To set the mode of file 'hello' the same as file 'olleh', you can use: 'chmod --reference=olleh hello'. This copies the permission mode from 'olleh' to 'hello'. Alternatively, you can first check olleh's permissions with 'ls -l olleh' and then apply the same permissions to hello using 'chmod' with the appropriate mode.",

For example: 'chmod 755 file' (permissions), 'chown user file' (owner), 'chgrp group file' (group).",

                "answer": "A file without any restrictions would have permission value 777 in octal notation or rwxrwxrwx in symbolic notation. This means all users (owner, group, others) have full permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). However, this is generally not recommended for security reasons, especially for sensitive files.",

                "explanation": "777 permissions mean everyone can read, modify, and execute the file, which poses security risks in most scenarios.",
